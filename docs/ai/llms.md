NEAR Docs hosts a [`llms.txt`](https://docs.near.org/llms.txt) file to provide information to help LLMs use the complete NEAR documentation at inference time.

While websites serve both human readers and LLMs, LLMs benefit from concise information gathered in a single, accessible location. This is critical for use cases like development environments, where LLMs need quick access to programming documentation and APIs.

## Using `llms.txt`

The `llms.txt` core purpose is to provide context that the AI agent can reference before generating or modifying code.

Using an `llms.txt` file as a reference for AI coding agents is an advanced technique to guide the AI's behavior, improve code quality, and enforce project-specific patterns. It's essentially a way to provide contextual, in-the-flow documentation.

Next, you can find examples of how to integrate `llms.txt` with [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code) and [Cursor](#cursor).

## Visual Studio Code

To use [NEAR Docs llms.txt](https://docs.near.org/llms.txt) as reference when working with Copilot Chat, follow these steps.

1. Open the Copilot Chat sidebar on VS Code.
2. Ask your question, and use the `#fetch` keyword to add `https://docs.near.org/llms.txt` as reference.
   For example:
   ```
   How can I upgrade a contract state?
   #fetch https://docs.near.org/llms.txt
   ```

## Cursor

When using Cursor, you can add [NEAR Docs llms.txt](https://docs.near.org/llms.txt) as documentation reference following these steps, so it will be available when asking questions to the AI agent.

1. Open Cursor Chat window.
2. Click on `@`, select `Docs`, and `+ Add new doc`. On the text box, enter:
   ```
   https://docs.near.org/llms.txt
   ```
